; Performs a couter-write loop onto RAM in the 6502
; only does an 8 bit section, didn't want to mess with
; trying to do 16 bit operations yet. 
; reads it back and compares each bit to the counter 
; Indicates if the bytes matched or not.

; $0000 - $3FFF - 16kb SRAM location
; $6000 - $7FFF - WDC65C22 address location
; $8000 - $FFFF - AT28C256 ROM location
; $FFFC - $FFFD - initialization vector
